                        <li>Our project Tech-Savvy Home is a solution for sorting the complexity and the an advanced smart home system that facilitates the error deduction in the home circuit environment.</li><br>
                        <li> That allows a typical smart home system to make effective decisions based on the status of other devices in the network. </li><br>
                        <li>This is also capable of doing the common things that other smart home systems can, such as remotely controlling the device. It will be in a very user-friendly interface with a large market. </li><br>
                        <li>This project presents a single controller which can be used in any type of devices that are integrated to the eco-system. </li><br>
                        <li>This serves as a surveillance system for the house that is accessible or observable at any time and from any location.</li><br>

                            <h3>Background</h3>

                            <li>Research and development of an advanced smart home controlling system that enables users to experience the finest home ecosystem, focus on the controller customization they want, and manage all of their home appliances from a single controller.</li>
                            <li>The implementation of the servers not only provides private space for the user to manage his data but also serves as a host for our website through which he can see and control the status of the house.</li><br>
                            <li>The reduced form of the controller rather from the others as a individual controller for the desired IoT’s, to a single controller for all the IoT and to extend the level of the controller from the smart devices to all the appliances in the house covers all the smart and non-smart devices.</li><br>

                            <h3>Objectives</h3>

                           <li>Single controller for all IoT’s.</li><br>
 <li>Web app controller for both smart and non-smart devices.</li><br>
 <li>Full-fledged dashboard for smart home.</li><br>
 <li>Control over World Wide Web from any places.</li><br>
 <li>Error detection over the circuits of smart devices.</li><br>
 <li>Enhance the smart home’s security and stability.</li><br>
 <li>Individual server for each home.</li><br>

                            <h3>Differences between those projects and what we do</h3>

                            <li>A centralised controller for all IoT and other home-based devices.</li>
                            <li>If a component of an integrated system malfunctions, the owner is
                                informed.</li>
                            <li>Adding information about the location and health of family members to the user
                                interface.</li>
                            <li>Their entire home's status in a single GUI.</li>
                            <li>Security considerations will be applied to the machine learning algorithm.</li>
                            <li>The prior home automation solutions on the market are both expensive and complex.</li>
                            <li>The potential security and safety risks associated with implementing the previously
                                suggested home automation systems have not been taken into account.</li>
                            <li>The previously suggested home automation system is incapable of making wise choices.

                    <p>

                        A microcontroller is a compact, reasonably priced microcomputer that is made to carry out the functions of embedded systems, 
                        such as displaying microwave information and receiving remote signals, among others.

                    <div class="topic"> Real Time Operating System (RTOS):</div>
                    <p>
                         
An RTOS, also referred to as a real-time operating system, is a piece of software that swiftly shifts between jobs, 
                        creating the impression that several programmes are running simultaneously on a single processor unit.<br>
                        The processor core can only run one programme at a time, thus the RTOS quickly switches between different programming threads (also known as Tasks) to create the illusion that numerous programmes are running at once.

                    <div class="topic">Internet of Things (IoT)</div>
                    <p>
                       The term "Internet of things" refers to actual physical things that have sensors, computing power,     software, and other technologies and can link to other systems and devices via the Internet or other communication networks and exchange data with them. Because items merely need to be connected to a network and be individually addressable, the term "internet of things" has been criticized as being misleading.<br>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <div class="topic">Web app</div>
                    <p>
                        The web app is the main controller, connected to the microcontrollers which has already connected to IoT’s and other devices through a medium of server. In this project we have implemented flask server. <br>Python-based Flask is a microweb framework. Since it doesn't require any specific tools or libraries, it is categorized as a microframework. It lacks any components where pre-existing third-party libraries already provide common functions, such as a database abstraction layer, form validation, or other components.

                    <p>Avisual display of all of your data. While it can be used
                        in all kinds of different ways, its primary intention is to provide information at-a-glance,
                        such as KPIs. A dashboard usually sits on its own page and receives information from a linked
                        database.</p><br>
                    <h2>Function:</h2><br>

                    <p>A dashboard is an information management tool that tracks the condition of your business,
                        a department, a campaign, or a specific process by tracking key performance indicators (KPIs),
                        metrics, and vital data.</p>
